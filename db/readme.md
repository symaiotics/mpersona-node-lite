# LowDB Folder
This folder contains the lowdb JSON files which are used to contain the relevant data. 
Each schema that is created has its own .json file.

In mPersona-lite, these are saved locally. In mPersona 1.0 these are saved to a DocumentDB.
In your own implementation, you can normalize this data into a realtional database or continue to persist it as a document.
